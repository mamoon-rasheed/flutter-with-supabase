# Flutter Supabase Todos üìù

A modern and interactive Todo list application built with Flutter and Supabase. This project demonstrates a full-stack Flutter application, including database operations (CRUD), user authentication, real-time data streaming, and a polished user interface with both light and dark modes.



## ‚ú® Features

- **Full CRUD Functionality**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Email/password sign-up and sign-in.
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only see and manage their own tasks.
- **Real-time Data Sync**: Changes reflect instantly across devices without needing a refresh.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Sleek, interactive design with swipe-to-delete gestures.
- **Light & Dark Mode**: Easily switch between themes with a persistent choice.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL Database, Authentication, Realtime)
- **State Management**: Provider (for theme switching)
- **Environment Variables**: `flutter_dotenv`

## üöÄ Getting Started: Local Setup Guide

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed. ([Installation Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install))
- **Git**: You must have Git installed to clone the repository.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/mamoon-rasheed/flutter-with-supabase.git](https://github.com/mamoon-rasheed/flutter-with-supabase.git)
cd flutter-with-supabase
````

### 3\. Set Up the Supabase Backend

This project requires a Supabase project to function as its backend.

**A. Create a Supabase Project**

  - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
  - Save your **Project URL** and `anon` **public key** for a later step.

**B. Create the `todos` Table**

  - In your Supabase project, go to the **SQL Editor** and run the following script to create the `todos` table with the correct columns and settings.

<!-- end list -->

```sql
-- Create the 'todos' table
CREATE TABLE todos (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,
  task TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_complete BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for the 'todos' table
ALTER TABLE todos ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create RLS policies
-- 1. Allow users to see only their own todos
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for own users" ON todos
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 2. Allow users to insert their own todos
CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for own users" ON todos
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 3. Allow users to update their own todos
CREATE POLICY "Enable update for own users" ON todos
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 4. Allow users to delete their own todos
CREATE POLICY "Enable delete for own users" ON todos
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**C. Configure Authentication**

  - Go to **Authentication** -\> **Providers** and ensure the **Email** provider is enabled.
  - For easier testing, you can temporarily disable **Confirm email** under the Email provider settings.

### 4\. Configure Environment Variables

  - In the root of your cloned Flutter project, create a file named `.env`.
  - Open the `.env` file and add your Supabase credentials, which you saved earlier:

<!-- end list -->

```
SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL_HERE
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE
```

  - In your `pubspec.yaml` file, ensure the `.env` file is listed under `assets`:

<!-- end list -->

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - .env
```

### 5\. Install Dependencies and Run the App

  - Run the following commands in your terminal from the project's root directory:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# Get all the required packages
flutter pub get

# Run the app on your connected device or emulator
flutter run
```

You should now have the app running successfully on your local machine\! üéâ
